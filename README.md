# Audio-Deepfake-Detection
step 1:Identify 3 Promising Models/Approaches
| Model name | RawNet2 (End-to-End Deep Learning Model) | Wav2Vec 2.0 (Self-Supervised Pretrained Model) | LCNN (Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network) + FFT Features |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Key Innovation** | Uses a ResNet-like deep learning architecture to process raw waveforms directly, eliminating the need for handcrafted feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs). Leverages gated recurrent units (GRUs) to capture temporal dependencies in audio. | Uses a self-supervised learning approach to pre-train on massive amounts of unlabeled speech, improving feature representation. Fine-tuned for deepfake detection by distinguishing real vs. fake speech patterns. | Uses Fourier transform features (spectrograms) combined with a Lightweight CNN (LCNN) for efficient classification. Compact model suitable for low-latency, real-time applications. |
| **Performance** | Reported EER (Equal Error Rate): ~1.06% on the ASVspoof dataset. Works well in real-time detection scenarios. | Achieves over 95% accuracy on several deepfake datasets. | EER: ~3.85% on ASVspoof dataset. Optimized for low-resource environments. |
| **Why it's promising** | End-to-end approach simplifies feature engineering. Good balance between performance and computational cost. Can generalize to various types of audio deepfakes. | Pretrained on large-scale audio data, making it robust to different deepfake methods. Adaptable to real-time applications with fine-tuning. | Lightweight and efficientâ€”ideal for real-time scenarios. Can be deployed on edge devices. |
| **Challenges** | Requires significant training data to generalize well. Susceptible to adversarial attacks. | Computationally expensive to fine-tune. Requires careful selection of fine-tuning data. | May struggle with unseen deepfake techniques. FFT-based features could miss temporal artifacts present in raw waveforms. |
