# Audio-Deepfake-Detection
step 1:Identify 3 Promising Models/Approaches
1. RawNet2 (End-to-End Deep Learning Model)
Key Innovation:
Uses a ResNet-like deep learning architecture to process raw waveforms directly, eliminating the need for handcrafted feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs).
Leverages gated recurrent units (GRUs) to capture temporal dependencies in audio.
Performance:
Reported EER (Equal Error Rate): ~1.06% on the ASVspoof dataset.
Works well in real-time detection scenarios.
Why it’s promising:
End-to-end approach simplifies feature engineering.
Can generalize to various types of audio deepfakes.
Good balance between performance and computational cost.
Challenges:
Requires significant training data to generalize well.
Susceptible to adversarial attacks.
2. Wav2Vec 2.0 (Self-Supervised Pretrained Model)
Key Innovation:
Uses a self-supervised learning approach to pre-train on massive amounts of unlabeled speech, improving feature representation.
Fine-tuned for deepfake detection by distinguishing real vs. fake speech patterns.
Performance:
Achieves over 95% accuracy on several deepfake datasets.
Why it’s promising:
Pretrained on large-scale audio data, making it robust to different deepfake methods.
Adaptable to real-time applications with fine-tuning.
Challenges:
Computationally expensive to fine-tune.
Requires careful selection of fine-tuning data.
3. LCNN (Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network) + FFT Features
Key Innovation:
Uses Fourier transform features (spectrograms) combined with a Lightweight CNN (LCNN) for efficient classification.
Compact model suitable for low-latency, real-time applications.
Performance:
EER: ~3.85% on ASVspoof dataset.
Optimized for low-resource environments.
Why it’s promising:
Lightweight and efficient—ideal for real-time scenarios.
Can be deployed on edge devices.
Challenges:
May struggle with unseen deepfake techniques.
FFT-based features could miss temporal artifacts present in raw waveforms.
